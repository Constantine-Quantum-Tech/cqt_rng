An illustration of a bitstring where the $P(0) = P(1)$ but the bitstring is not random is this $01010101$. We can see that $P(0) = P(1)$ but given that we know that the $i$-th is $0$ we are guaranteed that the $i+1$-th bit is 1 and vice versa. A bias might be more suble where given that we know that the $i$-th is a certain value there is unequal probabilities for $i+1$-th bit to be $0$ or $1$.\n",

As we saw in the previous sections, looking for the frequencies of $0$s and $1$s (entropy) is not enough. We should also look for repeating words, patterns, and etc. In what follows, we will assess the randomness of our bitstring by the using the [nistrng package](https://pypi.org/project/nistrng/), which is a python package implementing the 15 tests of the [NIST SP 800-22](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf) test-suite.

    "In this notebook, we showed the importance of RNGs and the theory behind them, and how to build one. We also mentionned two methods to post-process entropy sources output depending if you value rate (Von Neumann) over biasness (CQTPP). Then, we presented a tool that we developped to generate random numbers. The tool was developped to be **simple and extendible to fit users' needs  and resources**. Finally, we passed the results that tool provides (for IBMQ and Borealis) through a battery of tests. We saw that the bitstrings that are generated are **evenly distributed and that they get decent NIST scores**."
