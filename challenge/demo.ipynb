    "Now, for the bitstring to be truly unbiased the probability of having $0$ or $1$ should be equal BUT ALSO the probability to have $00$, $01$, $10$, $11$ should be equal (and the same applies for longer combinations of 0,1).  An illustration of a bitstring where the $P(0) = P(1)$ but the bitstring is not random is this $01010101$. We can see that $P(0) = P(1)$ but given that we know that the $i$-th is $0$ we are guaranteed that the $i+1$-th bit is 1 and vice versa. A bias might be more suble where given that we know that the $i$-th is a certain value there is unequal probabilities for $i+1$-th bit to be $0$ or $1$.\n",
